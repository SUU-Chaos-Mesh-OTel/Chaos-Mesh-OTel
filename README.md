## 1. Introduction
Chaos Mesh is an open source cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform. It offers various types of fault simulation and has an enormous capability to orchestrate fault scenarios. Using Chaos Mesh, we can conveniently simulate various abnormalities that might occur in reality during the development, testing, and production environments and find potential problems in the system. To lower the threshold for a Chaos Engineering project, Chaos Mesh provides us with a visualization operation. We can easily design our Chaos scenarios on the Web UI and monitor the status of Chaos experiments.

Core strengths of Chaos Mesh:
* An easy-to-use system: Chaos Mesh makes full use of automation with graphical operations and Kubernetes-based usage.
* Cloud Native: Chaos Mesh supports Kubernetes environment with its powerful automation ability.
* Various fault simulation scenarios: Chaos Mesh covers most of the scenarios of basic fault simulation in the distributed testing system.
* Flexible experiment orchestration capabilities: We can design our own Chaos experiment scenarios on the platform, including multiple mixing experiments and application status checks.
* High security: Chaos Mesh is designed with multiple layers of security control and provides high security.
* Easily scalable: It's easy to add new fault test types and functions to Chaos Mesh.


## 2. Theoretical background / technology stack

### Key Technologies Used

- **Kubernetes**  
  A powerful container orchestration system used to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. Chaos Mesh runs natively within Kubernetes clusters.

- **Chaos Mesh**  
  The core Chaos Engineering platform used to inject faults into Kubernetes-managed applications for testing system resilience.

- **Chaos Dashboard**  
  A web-based UI for creating, managing, and visualizing chaos experiments and workflows.

- **Prometheus** (optional)  
  An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit used to collect metrics from the application during chaos experiments.

- **Grafana** (optional)  
  A visualization tool often paired with Prometheus to monitor the effects of chaos injections in real time.

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

| [frontend](/src/frontend)                           | Go            | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. Does not require signup/login and generates session IDs for all users automatically. |
| [cartservice](/src/cartservice)                     | C#            | Stores the items in the user's shopping cart in Redis and retrieves it.                                                           |
| [productcatalogservice](/src/productcatalogservice) | Go            | Provides the list of products from a JSON file and ability to search products and get individual products.                        |
| [currencyservice](/src/currencyservice)             | Node.js       | Converts one money amount to another currency. Uses real values fetched from European Central Bank. It's the highest QPS service. |
| [paymentservice](/src/paymentservice)               | Node.js       | Charges the given credit card info (mock) with the given amount and returns a transaction ID.                                     |
| [shippingservice](/src/shippingservice)             | Go            | Gives shipping cost estimates based on the shopping cart. Ships items to the given address (mock)                                 |
| [emailservice](/src/emailservice)                   | Python        | Sends users an order confirmation email (mock).                                                                                   |
